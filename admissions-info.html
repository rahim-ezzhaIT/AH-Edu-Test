                                <p>Student Finance England (SFE) is a service funded by the government. The Student Loans Company (SLC) operates it. SFE provides money to students who qualify. These students will enter higher education in the UK. This includes learners who are undergraduates or postgraduates.</p>
                                <p>Support might include the following which mainly depends on your course type; and, of course eligibility:</p>
                                <ul class="description-list">
                                    <li>Tuition Fee Loans: They are paid directly to your university. It is to cover course fees.</li>
                                    <li>Maintenance Loans: The funds are paid to you directly. They will help to cover living costs, like rent. It will help for books and food.</li>

                                <h4 class="fw-bold mb-4">Tuition Fee Loans vs. Maintenance Loans</h4>
                                <p>Tuition Fee Loan covers all costs. Yes it does, of your university fees. These are sent straight to your institution, but. A Maintenance Loan helps, with your living costs while you study there is. How much you get depends on your family income. Your location for study factors too, as well. So, do your living arrangements such as; living at home, or somewhere else? Most full-time students studying as undergraduates, can receive these loans. Some learners, studying part-time or as postgraduates, may qualify.</p>
                                <p>Postgraduate Loans Perhaps you are seeking a Master’s or a Doctorate, that would be great. You may get a Postgraduate Loan. The sum is around £12,471 for 2024–2025 to use for fees. You can use this, too; for study costs. Funds go straight to you. You use them as you like; it could be accommodation or supplies. No separate maintenance loan exists for postgraduate learners.</p>
